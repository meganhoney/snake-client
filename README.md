# Snake Client Project

Snake is a very popular video game. The game allows the player to maneuver a dot and increase its size by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from [here](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer).
